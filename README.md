# My NextJs Portfolio

This is a very special portfolio that I am super excited to share with you!

- Utilizes Next Js built in page routing, APIs, SSR, SSG & more

- Also utilizes the utility based css framework Tailwindcss

- Also implemented nodemailer for the contact form and using SendGrid as my SMTP

        Big Thanks goes to Manu Arora for this awesome template. He is an amazing developer who has developed some amazing projects. I highly recommend checking out!

# How can you can use this template yourself

1. Firstly you need to download the zip that contains the template

     - [Click Me to go to Simple Developer Portfolio Repository](https://github.com/manuarora700/simple-developer-portfolio-website)

   - Once you are on the page click the green code button which is circled blue in the image below. It will show a list of options. Click the one that says download zip which is circled red in the picture below:

2. Make sure to have Node JS and VScode installed before unzipping.

   - It is important to have NodeJs installed so you can be able to run the project

     - [Click me to download NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

   - I brought up VSCode as it is one of the best code editors and since its free takes it to the next level. You can use any editor as long as you know how to work it
     - [Click me to download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

3. Unzip and open in editor
   - Now that you have node js installed and your editor ready, go to your downloads and unzip. Then open it in your editor as seen below:

- Once you open the editor it is going to ask if you trust the author of the content. Click Yes and your editor should look similar to below:

4. Delete yarn.lock file as we will be using npm to manage the project not yarn

5. Open the terminal and install the dependencies

   - On windows click <code>ctrl + `</code> to open the terminal
   - On macOS click <code>command + `</code> to open the terminal

   Once you do that the terminal will open in the bottom

   In the terminal type <code>npm install</code> and press enter

   What this is doing is its downloading the packages that were used to set up the template. It may take a minute for all the packages to be installed

   The steps described are shown below

6. Run the project and begin making it your own!!

   - In the same terminal, once it finished installing, run the command <code>npm run dev</code>
   - Then open this link in your web browser: http://localhost:3000
   - npm run dev starts the development server so you can start working on it in your code editor and see what those changes look like via the link you typed in the browser!

# Soon I will be adding a more in depth tutorial of how to fully customize the template. Stay tuned :)
